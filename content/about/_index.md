Hey, I’m Jonathan, and this is my small blog website. I’m currently a third-year software engineering student, but find enjoyment in many other fields, especially mathematics, history, politics, and philosophy. The goal of this site is just to be able to have a place to post anything, whether it be WASM experiments, old essays, or just blog posts. Recommendations are always appreciated, either send me a message over one of the accounts on /socials or over my email.
